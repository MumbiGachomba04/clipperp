# CLIPPER+ Examples

Here you can find example codes for running CLIPPER+ and registering pointclouds. Note that in order to run the examples, CLIPPER+ must be compiled with Python/MATLAB binders.

### Datasets

Download the pointcloud datasets from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-SshbPvfBeVXw3r7OazfwO0A1kwNSy23?usp=sharing).

Uncompress the dataset and save it in the "data" folder.


### Matlab demos

There are 2 Matlab demos:
- `demo_clipperp`: For using to CLIPPER+ maximal clique in a graph
- `demo_pointcloud_regist`: For registering pointclouds using the CLIPPER+ maximal clique solution


### Python demos

Will be added soon.
